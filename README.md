The content of this repo is an extension of work completed for a simple to-do list application made following a Udemy
course by Ardit Sulce. 

Reference:

cli.py - command-line interface App
gui.py - general user interface App
functions.py - module for reused functions to manage the to-do list
todos.txt - text file data storage for the todo list

Once I've finished following along with this course I'd like to implement a database storage system and work on my own 
styling and functionality additions
